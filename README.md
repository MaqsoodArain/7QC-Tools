# 7QC-Tools
The webpage provides images of the 7 Quality Control Tools used to improve business processes. 

Basic Project Requirements:
1. I have included two media queries. The navigation bar changes from column to horizontal layout. In addition the webpage displays one column on mobile, two columns on Ipad and three columns on desktop screen sizes.
2. I have made the minimum of 5 uploads to GitHub.
3. The README files basic on information on the purpose of the webpage.
4. (i) The navigation menu expands and collapses. The webpage also includes a table which uses the ":nth-child" style to format the table.
    (ii) I have added a registration form in the webpage that takes inputs from the user and provides a 'Thank you' response when the user submits the form by clicking on the register button.
